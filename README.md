### Objective ###
Start the React project and develop the whole application, React components, React Router routes, following Figma models (responsive!). And this with a quality code!

### Back-end / data ###
Extraction of the last 20 housing announcements from the JSON file to build the corresponding Front.

### Functional constraints ###
● For scrolling photos in the gallery (Gallery component):
  - If the user is at the first image and clicks on "Previous image", the gallery displays the last image.
  - Conversely, when the image displayed is the last in the gallery, if the user clicks on "Next image", the gallery 
    displays the first image.
  - If there is only one image, the "Next" and "Previous" buttons do not appear.
 
● Collapse: By default, Collapses are closed on page initialization.
  - If the Collapse is open, the user's click closes it.
  - Conversely, if the Collapse is closed, a click opens it.

# Steps

### Step 1: Initialize the project ###
● The React application installed and the GitHub repo initialized.
● Added the JSON file which contains the data.
● The demo application that launches in the browser when I type `npm start` in the terminal.

### Step 2: Add React Router ###
● I should have React Router and its dependencies installed on my application.

### Step 3: Create the router and the various pages of the application ###
● I should have the routing of my functional application.
- Create the different pages of the application
- Create components by integrating the router component.
- The application layout for the main layout. We had different options (CSS, SASS, CSS modules).
==> Create a separate component for the router.

### Step 4: Create the homepage ###
● I should have the banner and card components created, and a list of available properties.
● Analyze the different components well and see if they are reused in the app. Evaluate which interface elements require a
component of their own.
● Be careful that the creation of cards does not generate a warning in console.

### Step 5: Create the About Page ###
